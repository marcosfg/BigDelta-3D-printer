BigDelta-3D-printer
===================


This projects was based on the smaller Delta 3D printer (https://github.com/marcosfg/Delta-3D-printer). The main updates are:

	- Bigger Build plate. This design should allow to print within a 300mm diameter build plate when enclosed and nearly 400mm when opened.
	- Vertical tower upgraded with 20x60mm aluminum profile to increase rigidity and allow the fixation of panels to enclose the build volume
	- Fixations on the extremities of the horizontal aluminum provide better alignment and higher rigidity

Printer specifications:

This printer was designs with the following specs:

	- Nema17 400deg/rotation stepper motors
	- GT2 belts and pulleys
	-
